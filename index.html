            <p class="txt">During his childhood and adolescence, he attended musical theater rehearsals, and formed jazz
                bands, a
                combination that "not only taught him the discipline and technique to harness and control his voice, but
                also to push his vocal range to the limit." He also maintains that he "had a passion for pop music". At
                the
                age of eight, he began taking voice lessons and writing songs with a local jazz singer named Joanna
                Eden,

        <p class="txtSam2">Despite having started his career between 2012
            and 2013, Smith did not begin to gain wide recognition
            until February 2014, when the video clip for his second
            single, "Money on My Mind", revealed his face and his own
            identity as a solo artist.3 Such was his success with his
            first two collaborations, that even before the release of
            his debut studio album, he caught the attention of critics
            and the British public by winning the Sound of 2014 poll
            conducted by the BBC . At the same time, he received the
            critics' choice award at the 2014 Brit Awards.</p>

            <h2><strong><em>2022–present: Glory</em></strong></h2>
            <p>On August 25, 2022, Smith announced that he had
                collaborated with German singer Kim Petras on a
                song for her forthcoming fourth studio album titled
                Gloria. A month later, on September 22, Smith together
                with Petras released the song "Unholy", which reached
                number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 list. This represented
                a milestone since it is the first song by a non-binary
                artist and a person transgender to reach that position
                on said list</p>
